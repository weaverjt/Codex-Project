// Javascript Entry-Objects for the Codex/Tracking-Keywords

/*
Basic Conception of objects:

Codex-Entries:
------
-Characters
-Groups
-Lore
-Places
-Beliefs
-Events
etc.
------

These will be the basic object templates that will cover 
all the various "types" of Codex-Branches that the user 
can select when developing their Codex...

Basic Flow:

    [NODE]--->[BRANCH]--->[SUB-BRANCH]--->[COROLLARIES]--->[ENTRY]
    --------------------------------------------------------------

    A set number of "Main-Branches" will be available for the user to add to the starting "Codex-Node."
    The starting node will be little more than a circle on screen with the user's title in it. By adding
    branches, they will be able to choose broad subjects---FACTIONS, for instance---and par them down into
    specific examples---such as the IMPERIAL FACTION or the RED-KNIGHTGUARD within the IMPERIAL faction---
    of various things that exist in their worlds. In doing so they'll be able to organize their thoughts
    and existing content as well as keep track of various Factions, Characters, etc. that they have already
    made (so they don't repeat the same element twice---no one needs two " headless black knights" in their
    story).
