Ideas:

-Write down outline for that "fix" of masters of Ragnorack.

N.K.
-Trashmen (gang)--
A mix of humans and tavi that do "cleansing" to prevent outbreaks of disease and "wards" in "area's of strife" (the sites of the nano-virus bombs that spurned the riots) to limit the "chaos in the human's nature at those sites.

They have "bruisers," the humans who do the maintenance and lifting, and "thin ones," (the tavi who accompany the humans to protect them against the nano-viruses lingering effects of the nano attacks). The latter wield what are described as "heat canons"--which I want the reader to basically picture a flame thrower--that are actually modified tavi light weapons.

-'Zerkers (gang)--
The ones who were in the imediate vacinity of the nano bombs and turned feral to some degree as well as those you joined later on (mainly drug adelled and penniless people from northern Pike) who suffer a lesser degree of animalistic behavior but are no less unstable (owing to their drug habit pitting their brain through continued abuse). 

Certain Zerkers have it more together (relatively speaking) and often take up leadership roles in the various raiding parties. These ones have much better reasoning and planning than the others while still being entrenched in the Zerker culture and spirit. They actually use their guns as they were intended the vast majority of the time. 
These Zerker "savants" are often marked for capture by an unknown party that will pay heafty bounties if the targets are brought in alive and in good condition.

[Need a name...Hunters for Hire?]
-Guild of Enforcers, Protectors, Hitmen, and Movers--
Another loosely bound faction at home within the Northern Pike. While they do not solely opperate in Northern Pike, most of their jobs involve this region. They are, along with Aiden Maleck's various businesses, the only Pike based organization that is permitted to opperate in Tyre (the territory of the Tharsis First) and tollerated to some degree in the other regions of Tharsis (not including Carthage). 
The Tharsis Federal Government views them as freelance fact finders and even employs them to glean information from Pike. In a gesture of reciprocation, day visas will be grant to some who hold a guild badge upon petition while other, higher level assets can come and go as they please--as long as they follow the rules and are transparent with their reasons for traveling.
The guild itself keeps in good graces by making public every aspect of its business--job records, receipts, memeber records, etc.--and paying taxes directly to the Federal (Carthagian) government.
