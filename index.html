<!-- This is a test product.
    I hope to accomplish 3 goals:
        1. gain an understanding of the WordApi
        2. Create code which tracks writing and complies stats
        3. Create a JS object(s) which can essentially hold a Character's profile and hold the various stats (see 2)
        associated with them. [i.e. how many times they've said this, the amount of times they've been angry/sad etc., etc.]
